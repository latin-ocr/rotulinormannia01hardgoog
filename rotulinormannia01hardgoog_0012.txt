'ffREFAcE.

 

THE existence of the Norman Rous‚ amongst the
archives of the Tower of London‚ has been long known
through the medium of Carte's Catalogue of the Gascon‚
Normam and French Rolls¹3 a work which has been held
in great estimation as well on the continent as in this
country.

These Rolls contain such letters and grants of the
Kings of England as almost exclusively relate to the
province& over which, whilst annexed to the English
crown, our monarchs exercised the same authority as in
this kingdom3 and these letters and g'rants of liberties

les Archives de la Tour de Londres. A Londri·3‚ 1743, 2 vols. solio.

Edited by Thomas Carte-
Carte’s original preface to this work was suppressed by order of the

French authoritieS, in consequence of the style in which it was written;
Μ. de PalmeuS, who was directed to find a person to write a preface to
thee work in lieu of cartes, obser-vva, “L'on a cru devoir supprimet
“ la preface qui est ὲ la tete de cet ouvrage etant templie (le l'autes
‘⁶ contre la langue Franqoise et ecrite dans un ordre qui la tendoit
“ presq’ inintelligible.” ·

The preface invariubly prefixed is from the pen of the S' de Bougain- ·
ville, and comprehends the principal subjecte in Cartv's pre-face and
prospectus for the publication of his work. The one suppressed is of
very rare occurrence, and is to be found otili in the few copies which
were presented to the· French court. A copy, with the two profacw,
and an autograph ‘⁶ aw=rtissmuent'' hy M. ‹le Paluwus stating tlw reason
for cancelling the origind proliaco, is in the libi-ary of Charlcs Georgo
Young, Esq„ York }1‹·rald.''
