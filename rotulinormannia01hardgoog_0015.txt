iv . PREFACE.

Valuable as Carte’s publication undoubtedly is, and
interesting as it may have been to France¹‚ yet it is a very
imperfect work3 for it does not refer to even a tenth part
of the documents enrolled. It must, however, be said, in

ustice to Carte, that he merely printed the calendars²
which he found in the Tower3 and that he was induced
to do so from a feeling of gratitude for the kindness he
had experienced during six years residence in France;
facts which ought to remove from that eminent writer
the reproach of having published so incomplete a work.

The defects in Carte’s Catalogue were first noticed by
M. de Brequigny³ in a ‚communication to the Memoires

¹ Mr. Cooper, in his work upon the Public RecordS, vol. i. p. 803, has
extracted a passage from an article in the Quarterly Review (vol. xxxix.
p. 52, 53), stating that the publication of Carte’s Catalogue was occa-
sioned by an art-et, in the nature of a general “ quo warranto informa—
tion,” issued by Cardinal Fleury‚ by which he attacked the franchises of
the religious and civil corporations of France. Every search has been
made for such an ‹zv-ret, but without success: neither has Carte, in his
prefaee, nor any French historiari, alluded to such a circumstance. The
writer in the Review is most probably mistaken‚ or has at least founded
his assertion on a paragraph in Barrington’s Observations upon the Sta-
tute of Gloucester‚ temp. Edw. I.

2 “ Je me suis propose de remedia, par rapport a la France‚ aux incon-
veniens qui ont rendu jusqu’a present inutiles les recherches des titres
qui l’interessent. Ayant passe plusieurs annees ῖι souiller dans les
differentes arehives d’Angleterre, afin d’y recueillir les memoires et les
materiaux‚ dont j'avois besoin pour la nouvelle histoire de ce royaume
ὲ laquelle je travaille‚ j’ai fait faire avec soin des copies exactes de tous
les catalogues ou schedules des rollcs contenues dans ces archives (de
la Tour de Londres‚) et en particulier celles des Rolles GasconS, Nor-

mane, et F ranqoisl’ Presace au Cataloque des Rolles Gascom, Nor-mans,
et F ναηςοὶε.
