PREFACE. jx

' To this just description of the defects of Carte's
Catalogue little need be added z but it may be proper to
state that, instead of exaggerating, Brequigny has greatly
underrated the deficiencies of that work. For instar-⁶⁶
from page 241 to page 246, in the first volume, only
hundred and sixty-nine instruments are noticed as bc
entered on the Norman Rolls in the reign of King Jc
whereas no less than nine hundred and twenty-eight
struments are to be found thereon 3 and neither the ]

of the 4th‚ nor the fragment of the 5th year of that re
are even referred tc. Again‚ with respect to the l

of the 5th of Henry the Fifth‚ the Catalogue menti⁴
two hundred and ninety-one instruments, whilst the
itself contains upwards of five hundred.

In the catalogue printed by Carte‚ the descriptim
the various documents are also so extremely meagre‚ a
give a very inadequate idea of the instruments themsel
Thus, “ de protectionibus concessis personiS‚ et vica
‘⁶ ac capellanis infra ducatum N ormanniae‚ nominati
(page 254) is the only indication which occurs of
whole of the important matter between pages 334
347 of this volume. The interesting document whic
merely alluded to by “ de licentia data quam plur]¹
‘⁶ magistris navium, qui ad deserviendum Regi in vi:
“ suo ad partes Franciae vadia perceperant, versus pa
“ suas proprias transeundi,'' contains the list of tl
shipS‚ with the names of their masters or command
and of the ports to which they belonged, which conve
Henry the Fisth and his army to Normandy, in the mc
of J uly 1417.ι ·

¹ The muster roll of that expedition is preserved in the Cha
House, westminster, and is one of the most interesting Recort
military history now extant·
