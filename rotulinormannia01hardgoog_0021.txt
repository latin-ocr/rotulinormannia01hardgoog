, · Independently of the omissions in Carte, errors of some
importance exist in the dates of instrumenta referred to z
for instance, the Vascon Roll for the 26th of King Henry
the Third is stated to be a record of the l6th year of that ’
reign, an extraordinary mistake3 for on· that very Roll
many important documenta are to be found relative to the
battle of Taillebourgh‚ fought between St. Louis and
Henry the Third, in the year 1242, ten years aster the date
assigned to it in the Catalogue3 an error in date which the
editors of the last edition of the Foedera have implicitly
followed. This is certainly a singular mistake for Carte
not to have discovered, who is admitted to be an his-
torian of no mean capacity and research. These remarks
upon the imperfectioris in the Catalogue edited by him
are not intended to cast a stigma upon that publication,
'but made with the view of vindicating the expediency
'of giving these valuable muniments themselves to the
public, in an authentic and authorised manner ¹, especially
as they contain numerous facts relating to the wars be-
tween England and France, from the commencement of
'the thirteenth to the middle of the fisteenth century,
which illustrate the general and particular history of both
kingdomS, and many of which have hitherto been scarcely
noticed by the writers of either nation.

THE NORMAN ROLLS.

This volume contains such of the NORMAN Roas of
the reign of King John as are now extant in the Tower,

¹ Barrington, in his Observations on the more ancient Statutes‚ speak-
ing of Carte’s Catalogues of the Norman, French, and Gascon Rolls,
remarkS, ‘⁴ That the titles only of these Records make two folio volumes;
4‘ it would certainly, however, be a work deserving the encouragement
‘⁶ of both nations, ,and of all learned men throughout Europe, to print

“ these instruments at length.’' p. '7 5.
