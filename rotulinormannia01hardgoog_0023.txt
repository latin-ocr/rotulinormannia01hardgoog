xii PREFACE.

'few exemplifications of final concords, are entered on this
Roll. A miscellaneous selection from the entries on this
and the other Norman Rolls of the reign of John will
enable the reader to form a tolerably correct idea of their

may appear of little value to English historianS, yet they
may prove of great utility to the historica] literature of

France.
