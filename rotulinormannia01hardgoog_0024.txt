PREFACE. xiii

cerning the prisage of wine at Dieppe, it shall be thus; as it
has been publicly testified before us and the aforesaid
Archbishop that that prisage was and used to be unj ustly
taken, it has been conceded, as well on our part as on
the part of the Archbishop, that henceforth it shall never
be taken by us or our heirS, nor by the said Archbishop
or his successore, either in time of peace or war. Con-
ceming the haye of Dampierre‚ it shall be thus; th'at,
whether the said Archbishop had any right ‘in it, by the
charter of the aforesaid King our brother, or not, we
release it to him and his successors for ever, lest here-
aster any contention arise concerning that haye between
us or our heirs and the Archbishop or his successors.
Conceming the storepond at Rouen, it shall be thus ; that
we will retain that storepond and the fishery thereos
in our own hands, so that we do nothing with the

water of that storepond to the damage or hurt of the “

millu of the Archbishop. Conceming pleas pertaining
to the sword, it shall be thus; as we ought to vene-
rate, love, and defend the church of Rouen above all
other churches of Normandy, as the mother of all the
churches of Normandy, and as that from which we and
our ancestors derive the honour of our duchy, whether the
same church of Rouen before had any right in those
pleas or not, we, for the honour of God and the Blessed
Virgin, grant to the same Archbishop and his successore,
for ever, all those pleas and all judgment of pleas, so that
justice be done in the sight of our chief Seneschal of

qui seroient convenables por armes porter, soient au secours et en
l'aide nostre sire le Duc, bien armez et appareillez chescun en droit sou
selon son poer, pour repeller et oster la force de ses ennemis, quicunque
mauferas d'armeures que il porront trouver et avoir, διο. Vetus consuetudo
