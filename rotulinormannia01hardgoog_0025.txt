xiv PREFACE.

Normandy, if he be present, or the nearest bailiff, when
he shall be called on for that purpose by the Archbishop‚
the bailiff doing nothing but merely seeing that justice be
done; all amendments and amerciaments arising out 'of
the aforesaid pleas shall belong to the Archbishop‚ and if
our bailiff do not come at the requisition of the Arch-
bishop‚ he shall be under our amerciamenn and we or
our Seneschal, when called upon, will send some one with-
out delay, who shall see justice done in the court of the
Archbishop‚ Conceming Norman rereban, it shall be
thus; that when, according to the custom of the land,
rereban should be called, the Archbishop‚ by us ‘or our
letterS‚ or by our Chief Seneschal or his letters, ought
to summon it, and the Archbishop shall summon rereban
according to the custom of the land, and shall lead it
or cause it to be led; and if rereban do not fully come,
justice on those who do not come and amerciaments and
escheats shall belong to the Archbishop; and he shall
not relax justice without us· Moreover, concerning the
passage of Dieppe, it shall be thus; that all those who
bring our letters of passage to our fairs shall have passage,
paying our dues. (Dated at Argentan, on the 7th of
June, A. D. 1200.)
