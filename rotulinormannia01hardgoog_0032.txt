ROTULUS DE VALORE TERRARUM
NORMANNORUM.

’ The Roll intituled ‘⁶ Ro'rtJLus DE VALORE TERRARUM
NORMANNORUM,” appears to be one of a serieS, but is the
only one extant. It specifies the value of the lands in
England holden by Normans in rebellion against the King
of England, and which escheated to the English crown.
Whilst Normandy was under the obedience of England,
the English held lands there by hereditary right, as did
the Normans in England. But upon the separation of
the two dominionS, the King of France seized the pos-
sessions of the English in Normandy, and the King of
England in like manner seized those of the Normans in
England. This Roll gives a curious and minute account
of the value of land, cattle, and agricultural produce at

that period.
