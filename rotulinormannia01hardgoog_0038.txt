PRE FACE. xxvii

The King to the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex‚
greeting. Whereas we have received certain information
and undoubted evidence that divers of our liegeS, who
lately came with us to our kingdom of France, where,
as we hoped, stoutly to oppose and resist the pride and
malice of our enemieS‚ have deserted us in the midst of
these our enemieS, and, without our licence, have, in

. great multitudeS, falsely and traiterously withdrawn and
returned to our kingdom of England‚ and are still daily
withdrawing and returning, which, if suffered to con·-
tinue, would manifestly turn, not only to the contempt
and prejudice of ηε, but to the serious injury and peril of
our faithful lieges accompanying us (which God averti).
We desirouS, as we are bound, to provide and ordain a
fitting remedy, in this matter, do command and strictly
enjoin you to arrest and take into custody without delay
all and each of those whom, by inquiry, information, or
other means whatsoever, you shall discover to have been
with us in our said kingdom of France, in our company,
or in that of otherS, and who have withdrawn themselves
thence without our licence, under our signet, or that of
the Constable of our army3 and to deliver them as soon
as taken to our very dear brother John Duke of Bedford,
Guardian of England. And, upon the fealty and alle-
giance wherein you are bound to uS, let this by no means
be neglected. Witness the King, at his castle of Caen,
in his duchy of Normandy, the Q9th day of September.
By the King himself.

Similar writs were sent . to all the sheriffs throughout

England.

The King to all to whom, δια, greeting. Know ye
that we have taken under our protection and defence
John Adam and John Galet, our sworn hege-men, and
