xxxvi PREFACE.

first part of either of those names is eight 3 . and, as clus-
ters like these, of several upright parallel strokeS, fre-
quently occur, the difficulty· of determining upon the
right reading may easily be conceived. There is
another cause of confusion upon which a remark is
necessary. Hitherto, in publications of records, words
ending in tio, Suc. have, with much impropriety, been
invariably spelt with a c, instead of the t. That mode
is here pursued, wherever it had the appearance of
c, but not otherwise ; for a manifest difference is osten
perceptible, in the early Bous, between the two letters,
especially in words where c and t stand in juxtafposition 3
for instance, in rectum and renam-3, διο. Again, there
are cases wherein the t occurs by itself, in substitution
for which a c is so decidedly inadmissible, that the Editor
has not adopted it, but it is not improbable that an oc-
casional error may be found to arise from the difficulty of
always distinguishing- between the c and ι’, from the

great similarity in the formation of those two letters by
some scribes.'’ ²

¹ For instance, the name of Wancy has the appearance on the roll of
Wauty, and has been more than once so read.
